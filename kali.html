        <h1>Dear Kali,</h1>
        <p>
            I so appreciate your letters and your jokes. I hear you are becoming quite a jokester! I have heard you have a funny duck joke that I hope to read in your next letter.<br><br>Kali, you are so bright. You have a light about you that shines for everyone to see. You feel things so strongly and you love others with that same strength. What a blessing you are to your family! Being the oldest is hard sometimes, but I hope you know what a great example you are to them. They love you dearly.<br><br>Thank you for sharing your cotton candy with your brothers. I am sure they loved it! You have given lots of gifts to Christ, and I think my favorite one to see is your friendship gift. You are friends with everyone and you want to include people who may feel forgotten. The Savior loves that.<br><br>I am excited to hear reports of you growing in your talents: piano, gymnastics, academics, or whatever it is that you choose to pursue.<br><br>Have a wonderful holiday season! I hope you like the presents from the North Pole.<br><br>Merry Christmas! <br>Love, <br>Santa<br><br>P.S. Your Santa song was very nice. Thank you!<br><br>P.P.S. How can you tell that Santa is real? You can always sense his presents. (Iâ€™m a bit of a jokester too)
